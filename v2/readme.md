Logic:

1. Provide user api key to make a clone of that user,
2. Make new account in bunq and save its session,
3. Make new accounts as clones for the original user interacted with,
4. Set their amount of money to be enough to pay for the original user,
5. Make payments between original user and the new users,

Improvements:

1. Make from-to date filter,
2. Add api keys for several users and create correct interaction between them,
